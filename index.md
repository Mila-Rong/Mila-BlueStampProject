# Sitting Posture Correcter
Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails!

You should comment out all portions of your portfolio that you have not completed yet, as well as any instructions:
```HTML

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials
Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs.

# Starter Project
For my starter project, I built a Arduino starter that has ability to detect whether there is an object in front and the distance from itself. This happens by using an ultrasounic sensor and LED. To measure the realtime distance, it will time the ultrasound emmited travel back and forth from the object. The ultrasound velocity is known as 340m/s, allow it to calculate the the distance(S = vt), and shown through serial monitor. To control the LED turn on when the object is near, Arduino IDE is utilized to add code and ensure the LED turn on when the distance is less than 6cm, off when the distance is greater than 6cm.
The main challenge I met is that the LED is always on. The first step I did is to change the digital write order from the critical distance mistakely written to ledpin serial number. The other one is to find the reason the LED is always on. Then I found the sencer measure the distance as 0 if an object is farther than it max distance, such as when there is nothing. Finally, I add code about not turn LED on when the distance is 0. However, this project allowed me to become comfortable using Arduino systems and related tools.
## Code
// Include NewPing Library
#include "NewPing.h"

// Hook up HC-SR04 with Trig to Arduino Pin 9, Echo to Arduino pin 10
#define TRIGGER_PIN 9
#define ECHO_PIN 10
// Maximum distance we want to ping for (in centimeters).
#define MAX_DISTANCE 1000000	

// NewPing setup of pins and maximum distance.
NewPing sonar(TRIGGER_PIN, ECHO_PIN, MAX_DISTANCE);

void setup() {
	Serial.begin(9600);//how fast it communicate
  const int ledPin = 13;//the ledPin is always Pin7
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);//the ledPin's job is always OUTPUT
}

void loop() {//Excute the order over and over again. Measure the distance between the ultranic senser ro the nearest object and determine whether to turn the LED on or not.
  int d = sonar.ping_cm();
  Serial.print("Distance = ");
	Serial.print(d);
	Serial.println(" cm");
  if (d < 6) {
    digitalWrite(13, 1);
  }
  if (d == 0){
    digitalWrite(13, 0);
  }
  else if (d > 6){
    digitalWrite(13, 0);
  }
  delay(100);
}
# Other Sources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
